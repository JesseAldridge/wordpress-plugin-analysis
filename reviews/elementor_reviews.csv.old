Terrible Tech Support,2,https://wordpress.org/support/topic/terrible-tech-support/,"

				
				<p>I have found Elementor useful for my new website. It is a powerful tool.<br />
But beware of Elementor if you need tech support. Their business model is that which makes it impossible to get live contact with tech support. No  phone, no chat, they don&#8217;t even answer their corporate office telephone.  My experience with their tech support for an installation issue made it  obvious that they know practically nothing. I finally gave up and found a  fix using Google. </p>

Один из лучших плагинов!,5,https://wordpress.org/support/topic/%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%bd-%d0%b8%d0%b7-%d0%bb%d1%83%d1%87%d1%88%d0%b8%d1%85-%d0%bf%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%b3%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2-3/,"

				
				<p>Хотелось бы еще попробовать возможности плагина в Pro версии, чтобы окончательно убедиться, стоит его покупать или нет!<br />
Спасибо разработчикам за их труд, и за отличный продукт!</p>

update to 2.5.7 broke my website,4,https://wordpress.org/support/topic/latest-update-broke-my-website-2/,"

				
				<p>Had to roll back to 2.4.7, which meant that a few nice improvements now have to be hidden until I can at least get back to 2.5.6. First time this has happened with Elementor. Perhaps you guys need to slow down on the updates to test them more thoroughly in future.</p>
<p>EDIT: Now I&#8217;m back on 2.5.7 after figuring out which plugin Elementor no longer plays nicely with. It&#8217;s Speed Booster Pack. Seems they are rushing updates out these days and this was an issue I didn&#8217;t need this morning.</p>

Easy to manage,5,https://wordpress.org/support/topic/easy-to-manage-18/,"

				
				<p>I&#8217;m not too computer savvy, but a couple youtube/wordpress videos and the easy of wordpress it self has made it doable. Once completed, it was super easy to manage. Click here to add to the site, click here to delete, and click here to update. </p>
<p>Thank you </p>
